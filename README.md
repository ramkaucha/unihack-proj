# SOLVE (Real Problems, Real Solutions)

SOLVE is a web platform designed to connect aspiring developers with real-world tech problems that often get overlooked by big companies. It provides a unique opportunity for developers to work on meaningful, practical projects instead of the typical beginner projects like e-commerce sites or to-do lists. By solving everyday tech challenges, developers gain hands-on experience, collaborate with like-minded peers, and build a portfolio that stands out. 

SOLVE also helps regular users by providing solutions to their everyday tech problems, creating a win-win environment for both developers and users. Whether you're a developer looking for exciting challenges or a user in need of solutions, SOLVE bridges the gap by turning real problems into real solutions.
